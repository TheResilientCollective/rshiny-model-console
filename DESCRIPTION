Description: This package defines four interconnected shiny apps for running
    web based Resilient Community Games.  The applications are designed to 
    enable a subset of users (interpreters) to view, edit, and run a community 
    model while other users (players) view an overview of model state and timely
    "news" media curated by the interpreters.
