This package defines a shiny app for web based editing, running, and visualizing
Resilient Community Dynamic Systems Models (RCDSM).

## Installation

To install the development version:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TheResilientCollective/rshiny-model-console")
```

## Shiny App

This web tool allows users to upload an RCDSM in the form of an xmile file, 
modify parameters, and download the modified xmile.

The control view is made up of the following functional tabs:

- parameters
  - upload model file
  - edit model parameters
  - download: fetch full model file with current state including 
    - parameter changes
    - simulation state
- simulation
  - advance model state
  - undo or rollback?
- visualization
  - visualize outputs

## Docker and proxy

We use ShinyProxy to provide an authentication layer and serve the app within
a docker network.  This is for deployment and deployment testing only.  For
shiny development, just run locally in R, or use RStudio, which has it's own
single-page browser.  Here we describe the docker infrastructure from the
ground up:

- `resilient-apps` is a docker image defined by `./Dockerfile` containing the
  shiny apps exposed on port 3838
- `resilient-proxy` is a docker image defined by `inst/serve/proxy/Dockerfile` 
  and `inst/serve/proxy/application.yml` which
  - runs the proxy server
  - handles authentication and access permissions
  - serves the shiny apps by spinning up containers from `resilient-apps`,
    one container per app
- `./compose.yml` creates a network and spins up the resilient proxy container
  - the user in the proxy container needs access to /var/run/docker.sock for
    creating images
  - this is set from the DOCKERGRP env variable, which can be set on the command line

### 

### Service Deployment:  

#### CI and Github actions

containers for resilientucsd/resilient-games-proxy and 
resilientucsd/resilient-games-app are created using github actions.
If you are running on a non-main branch, edit .github/workflows/resilient*.yml 
and add the branch.

#### Configuring and Running
- copy the example.env to rshiny.env
  - this is fixed on the compose file, for now.
- edit PROXY in env, and set passwords, 
    - if OSX, then set `SHINYPROXY_DOCKER_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:2375`
    - if other, then set `SHINYPROXY_DOCKER_PROXY=unix:///var/run/docker.sock` see `https://gist.github.com/styblope/dc55e0ad2a9848f2cc3307d4819d819f`
      - (localhost from a container is localhost)
      - you need to set DOCKERGRP= (some number)
          - `getent group docker | cut -d: -f3`
      - volume needs to be mapped into the container as a volume 
  ```yaml
  volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  ``` 

### command to run just the rshiny
`docker compose --env-file rshiny.env -f rshiny_compose_deploy.yaml up`


Command to run (tested on ubuntu):
`sudo DOCKERGRP=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3) docker compose --env-file rshiny.env  -f inst/serve/compose.yml up`


### Development mode on osx

To run this on a mac some changes have to be made:
- add `url: http://host.docker.internal:2375` under `proxy.docker` in application.yml
- build the proxy image
  - NOTE: this is pre-built at rishig32/resilient-proxy-osx
  - will have to be rebuilt for any changes to the proxy application.yml
    - `sudo docker build . -t rishig32/resilient-proxy-osx` in that dir after adding the url
- run with `sudo docker compose -f inst/serve/compose.yml -f inst/serve/compose-osx.yml up`
  - NOTE: `DOCKERGRP` not required, but will raise a warning
